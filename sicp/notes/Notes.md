Structure Interpretation of Computer Programs
==============================================

### Elements of Programming - Chapter 1

#### Main Concepts

 - Types of expressions
  - Primitive  represents simple entities associated with a language
  - Combination means of combinations by which compound elements can be built from the primitives
  - Abstraction means of abstraction, by which compound elements/combinations can be named and manipulated as units

```racket
 (+ 21 35 12 7) #prefix notation

 (+ (* 3
       (+ (* 2 4)
          (+ 3 5)))
    (+ (- 10 7)
       6))
```
- Global Environment allows the possibility of associating values with symbols and storing it such that
   it can be retrieved for later use.

- Evaluating Functions
